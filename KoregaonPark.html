It is primarily a residential area with lush greenery, but of late has been growing into a commercial hub as well. Koregaon Park also has a trendy dining and nightlife hub, with sleek European and Indian restaurants, plus live music bars and buzzy pubs. It is also a destination for art and music enthusiasts in the city with many art galleries and clubs in the vicinity.[1] Koregaon Park is located about 5.8 kilometres (3.6 mi) from the Pune International Airport and about 3.8 kilometres (2.4 mi) from the Pune Junction railway station."</p>
